## Where to find us?

Unfortunately we're **still waiting to be approved** by Google Play for the time being.

**Updates will be posted** as soon as this changes.

For now, if you know how you can install the app from the code found in our **GitHub repositry [found here](https://github.com/LefalChizzle/X15Symput)**
