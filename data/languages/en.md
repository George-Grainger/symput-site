## Supported languages

We currently aim to **support three languages** in our products:

1. [English](languages)
2. [Arabic](/ar/languages)
3. [Chinese (simplified)](/zh-cn/languages)

The reason for picking these three languages is that these are those spoken in our project team.
To change your language, click on the settings _(cog)_ button in the navbar, then click on the flag of the language you recognise.

## Limitations:

Note that currently we **don't translate posts or user profiles** , meaning the information will only be available in the input language.

## Adding more languages

If you **want to translate the site** into another language feel free to do so and we will add it. As far as we're concerned the more the merrier.

If you don't have the time to translate the site yourself let us know the language you'd like in the feedback section. If enough people agree that there's a demand **we'll add the language**.

## Spotted a mistake?

There are no doubt mistakes on our site. We'd appreciate you **letting us know** and we will work to correct mistakes. Whether you spot a typo or grammatical error let us know either through [feedback](/feedback) or by [contacting us](/contact-us)!
