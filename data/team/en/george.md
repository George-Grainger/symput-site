## About

I'm 20 years old with a years experience creating websites.

I've lived in Newcastle all my life until moving to Manchester this year.

## Interests

I'd quite like to get into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and lower-level languages though haven't got round to starting yet.

I'm interested in cybersecurity though I'm very much a beginner (please let me know any good sources to get started)!

I'd also like to try learning a 3d JS library like [three.js](https://threejs.org/) but I'm not sure when I'll get round to doing it.

## Hobbies

I like playing sports, particularly rugby and tennis.

I also enjoy reading from time to time, though probably don't do it as often as I should.

## Future hopes

To be allowed to go on holiday again.
